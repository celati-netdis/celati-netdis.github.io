<p align="right"><i>“There is a history in all men’s lives”</i><br>
William Shakespeare</p>
 

Why should one in the third millennium decide to dedicate one's own life to the study of history? Doesn’t our hectic and rather superficial age push us to focus on the here and now, leading us to think we live in a perennial present? Is there space for history, and humanistic knowledge in general, in our market-oriented and tech-based world? Can new technologies improve our research strategies in history? Can our humanistic knowledge help us to reconsider the way we think about science in turn? And is there any value in bringing to light, and carefully analysing, unknown stories from the past?


Throughout this website, you will find my personal insights on these questions, and you will have the chance to become more familiar with historical methodology, goals and outcomes. Mixing religious and medical history, combining archive research and [digital humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities) tools, I have tried to find my own way to put different disciplines in dialogue. Moreover, I have attempted to make history relevant and understandable to a contemporary audience. I hope you will find my effort worthwhile, and I am looking forward to hearing any comments and suggestions you may want to share with me.
