# Dependencies

This website uses Jekyll and its built-in SCSS compiler for the associated CSS, so be sure to install Jekyll first.

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

If you don't have the `bundler` gem installed, you can install it this way:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

More information on how to install and quick start Jekyll can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

This website also uses Bootstrap, JQuery, and Popper.JS for stylization purposes. Documentation on them can be found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/), [here](https://api.jquery.com/), and [here](https://popper.js.org/popper-documentation.html). Here is also [a guide on how to add Bootstrap](https://simpleit.rocks/ruby/jekyll/tutorials/how-to-add-bootstrap-4-to-jekyll-the-right-way/) to Jekyll.
