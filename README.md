# Dependencies

This website uses Jekyll and its built-in SCSS compiler for the associated CSS, so be sure to install Jekyll first.

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

If you don't have the `bundler` gem installed, you can install it this way:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

More information on how to install and quick start Jekyll can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).
